# temperature-sensor-predictor
For this Physical World 2D project, my group was tasked to develop a program to predict the temperature of a water bath using an R-pi and a temperature sensor.

As the conventional temperature sensor takes approximately 100 seconds to record the temperature of the water bath, we used machine learning to predict the temperature of the water bath within 10 seconds.

We are required to predict the temperature using a sensor within the range of +/-1.5℃ from the commercially available thermometer as fast as possible and also to create a GUI to display the information required for the demonstration.

We started taking data of the change in temperature of the sensor while it was in the water bath. Followed by modelling our program through machine learning to be able to predict the possible temperature of the water bath with linear regression.

Lastly, we were successfully predicting the temperature of the water bath using our model within approximately 8.8 seconds and within +/- 1℃ between the sensor and thermometer reading.
